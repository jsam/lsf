# Feature: Login and User Management System

## User Outcomes
What users can do with this feature:
- [OUT-001] User can authenticate with email/password to access the application
- [OUT-002] Admin can register new accounts with role-based permissions 
- [OUT-003] User can manage their profile and account settings 
- [OUT-004] User can reset forgotten passwords to regain access without administrator intervention
- [OUT-005] User sees clear feedback about authentication status and session management throughout their workflow

## Success Criteria
Feature works when:
- [ ] Valid users can log in within 2 seconds and access appropriate factory features based on their role
- [ ] New users can self-register and begin using non-privileged factory features immediately
- [ ] Password reset flow completes successfully without manual intervention
- [ ] User sessions persist appropriately and expire securely to maintain workflow continuity
- [ ] Role-based access controls prevent unauthorized access to sensitive factory operations
- [ ] User management scales to support team-based software development projects

## Constraints
External limitations:
- Depends on: Email service for password reset and account verification
- Must comply with: Basic data protection standards for user credentials and personal information
- Cannot exceed: 100 concurrent users as per non-functional requirements
- Performance target: Authentication operations must not impact the system performance
