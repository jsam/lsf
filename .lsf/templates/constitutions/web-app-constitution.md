## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles, architecture, and governance for the {{PROJECT_NAME}} project. All development activities, architectural decisions, and operational practices must comply with these constitutional principles.

## Article 0: Agentic Development Principles
1. **Context Efficiency**: Context is limited and precious, only provide relevant information
2. **Minimalism**: Complexity is cost, always try to reduce features and assumptions to the minimum scope that remains compliant with the provided requirements.
3. **Reasonable Defaults**: stick to default or existing implementations where possible
4. **Agent-centric content**: Artifacts between Spec and Code are generated by agents for agents and must be optimized accordingly
5. **Focus**: This is a software factory, all artifacts created must contribute to efficient software production. Exclude all business/stakeholder related topics.
6. **Boundaries**: make sure all tasks and functions are as cleanly separated as possible, blury boundaries will break the software factory

## Article I: Core Development Principles

### Section 1: Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Every feature begins with failing tests
2. **Test Coverage Requirements**: Minimum {{MIN_COVERAGE}}% code coverage
3. **Test Types**:
   - Unit tests for all business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. **Test-First Enforcement**: Code without tests shall not be merged

### Section 3: API-First Development
1. **Contract-First**: API specifications before implementation
2. **Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning for all APIs
3. **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications required
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes require migration paths

## Article II: Architecture Principles

### Section 1: Twelve-Factor App Compliance
1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config**: Store configuration in environment variables
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes**: Execute app as stateless processes
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production similar
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin Processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

### Section 2: Security Requirements
1. **Authentication**: {{AUTH_METHOD}} required for all endpoints
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials
5. **Security Headers**: CORS, CSP, and other security headers configured

### Section 3: Performance Standards
1. **Response Time**: API responses under 500 ms (p95)
2. **Throughput**: Support 10 requests per second
3. **Database Queries**: Query optimization required (no N+1)
4. **Caching Strategy**: Redis/CDN for appropriate data

## Article III: Code Quality Standards

### Section 1: Code Style and Formatting
1. **Linting**: All code must pass linter checks
2. **Formatting**: Automated code formatting required
3. **Type Safety**: {{TYPE_CHECKING_REQUIREMENT}}
4. **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public interfaces

### Section 2: Architectural Patterns
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries
2. **Dependency Injection**: IoC container usage
3. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
4. **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation

## Article IV: Development Workflow

### Section 1: Version Control
1. **Branching Strategy**: {{BRANCHING_STRATEGY}}
2. **Commit Standards**: Conventional commits required
3. **Pull Request Template**: Standardized PR format
4. **Protected Branches**: Main/master branch protection

### Section 3: Monitoring and Observability
1. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
5. **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes

## Article V: Data Management

### Section 1: Database Principles
1. **Migrations**: Version-controlled database changes

### Section 2: API Data Contracts
1. **Schema Validation**: Input/output validation
2. **Error Responses**: Standardized error format

## Article VII: Governance and Amendments

### Section 1: Constitutional Authority
1. This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines
2. All team members must acknowledge and follow these principles
3. Violations require documented justification and approval

### Section 2: Amendment Process
1. Proposed amendments require:
   - Clear justification and impact analysis
   - Team discussion and consensus
   - Documentation of the change
   - Version increment
2. Major amendments require:
   - Architecture review
   - Security assessment
   - Performance impact analysis
3. All amendments must be recorded in `amendments/` directory
